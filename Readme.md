# Concurrency examples

This project utilizes the FileReader, which reads the files from the given directory based on the extension filter, to demonstrate the three approaches for concurrency:

- Task-based (using std::async)
- Composable futures
- Coroutines

### TODO:
- [ ] Composable futures (ReCpp ?)
- [ ] Expand on coroutines functionality
